issue with intergating highindex function into rflush but I am moving forward.. slow but forward

this function will need a lot of testing and review..so take times

meanwhile.. IT job searching and challenges.. API-interface... Android..

======================================
another programming issue

not my nite.. stuck on the same area-royal flush.. I believe I can't finish.. all the answers are there

this required me to put three to five different function to work together.. My mind just not working... how can I draw that? I guess that what the UML diagram.. about?

next level stuff, how to design a set of functions to work together and in a way, I can understand and share with ppl???

today, @coding wasn't good :/ where I require to join 5 or 6 functions together to get the royal flush part work but my mind doesn't work. I have to think how to pass the variable from one function to another. Go backward to the main code. All I did was backtracking the code. I got lost and find the way but very slow. This is like architecture!! 

Last few days, I have been focus on loops and logic of one single function like the challenge.. this is such a big change.

How do u guy work out coding from architectural level? Is there anyway, I can draw this on paper/standard method? So I can share my design(function views) with others before we start coding?? this will be useful

Learnt don't be afraid to look back into your code to discover error and look into thing that a wierd, u not understand.... that's how u learn and get better..

======================================
need to coding early.. 2hr per day is not much

run into a few bugs@snake/royal flush function..

epic struggle with royal flush function :/ Also discovered a bug in the snake function >,< plus side, I learnt a lot.

May be, I should start plan better but then I don't think I will see royal flush issue coming...




28May2013
======================================
snake/straight is done..

workin on royal flush.. suit part is difficult.. need the beginning index and end index of the snake

took 2hr 05, snake function took me 2hrs to completed

Royal flush 1hr20min today.. 

Why took me so long... I didn't draw it up on paper.. the flush use count as the way to do was wrong.. I only release at the end.. u should realised at the beginning.. that what planning is all about.. avoid this kind of situation...

======================================
Rome isn't build in a day.. there is a long way to go. be patient and keep doing it!!!

highest max();, I wrote the whole sort algorithm but there is another anwser way simplier, just hightest=$face[$x].. that's it!!!!

Kalki challenge is fun..

Get yr focus back to the poker game.. is_sanke -> who_won(); is a prototype.. 

focus on one thing@the time.... too forward looking is not gooood!

======================================
Spent an hour on is_snake function wouldn't get it working.. 

Now is 11:56, I don't want to go to sleep with a problem in my mind.. so I decided to stop

To avoid this, you should wake up early and face this challenge early on. If I wake up@9.. I should get it done by 11.. then I can keep working on the rest of the project but now I have to wait for the next day. 

If every nite, I run into a problem and don't have enough time to finish.. the whole is day is wasted. The project will go stalled!!!

Time management, wake up early!! and do coding early!!! Let try it out
