======================================
Spent an hour on is_snake function wouldn't get it working.. 

Now is 11:56, I don't want to go to sleep with a problem in my mind.. so I decided to stop

To avoid this, you should wake up early and face this challenge early on. If I wake up@9.. I should get it done by 11.. then I can keep working on the rest of the project but now I have to wait for the next day. 

If every nite, I run into a problem and don't have enough time to finish.. the whole is day is wasted. The project will go stalled!!!

Time management, wake up early!! and do coding early!!! Let try it out

Others:find an interest PS SDK video..
